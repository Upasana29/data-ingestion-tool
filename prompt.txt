Assignment: CDAP Integration Project
=========================================

Below are key prompts used during the development of my project with AI assistance (ChatGPT):

---

1. What is ClickHouse and how can I connect to it using Java?
→ Helped me understand the database, JDBC setup, and how to connect via Spring Boot.

2. I faced several issues while setting up Docker and working with Java/Spring Boot files — how can I resolve common errors?
→ Got support for resolving environment issues, dependency-related errors, IDE configuration problems, and Docker connection troubleshooting.

3. How can I preview the first 5 rows of an uploaded CSV file before inserting?
→ Received a step-by-step explanation and code to read, preview, and store uploaded files using OpenCSV.

4. Why am I getting duplicate records when uploading the same CSV multiple times?
→ Learned about the lack of truncate/deduplication logic and how to prevent duplicates before inserting.
